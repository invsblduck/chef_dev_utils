Helper scripts for developing against chef-cookbooks repo.
My local paths are hard-coded.

rcb_switch_latest.sh        -   merge latest updates into rcbops clone (ie., not
                                your fork), check it out, and update submodules.

rcb_knife_bulkupload.sh     -   upload all cookbooks in rcbops chef-cookbooks
                                clone (ie., not your fork).

rcb_knife_upload.sh         -   upload a single cookbook from anywhere on the
                                filesystem.

rcb_knife_roles.sh          -   upload all roles from clone of rcbops
                                chef-cookbooks/roles/*.rb (not your fork)

rcb_knife_bulkdelete.sh     -   bulk delete ALL cookbooks on chef server defined
                                in your knife.rb. 

rcb_git_status.sh           -   inspect the work tree of every submodule and
                                if it's dirty, show `git status' output.  exit
                                0 or 1 depending whether any modules were dirty.

rcb_resync_chefserver.sh    -   wrapper script that calls all of the above.

rcb_git_merge_upstream.sh   -   fetch latest updates from a remote named
                                `upstream' and merge them into current branch.
                                useful for getting updates into your fork.
