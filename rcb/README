Helper scripts for developing against chef-cookbooks repo.
Not too useful to others as my local paths are hard-coded.

rcb_git_merge_upstream.sh   -   fetch updates from remote named `upstream' and
                                merge them into current branch. good for getting
                                updates into your fork.

rcb_git_pull.sh             -   merge latest updates into rcbops clone (ie., not
                                your fork).

rcb_git_status.sh           -   inspect the working tree of every submodule and
                                show `git status' if it's dirty.  exit 0 or 1
                                depending whether any dirty modules were found.

rcb_knife_bulkdelete.sh     -   bulk delete ALL cookbooks on chef server defined
                                in your knife.rb. 

rcb_knife_roles.sh          -   upload all roles from chef-cookbooks/roles/*.rb

rcb_knife_upload.sh         -   upload all cookbooks from chef-cookbooks

rcb_resync_chefserver.sh    -   wrapper script to call all of the above
